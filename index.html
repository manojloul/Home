<pre><b><font face="Arial" size="2.5" color="darkblue">We have created an interface where just by logging in a student would get all the class and assignment
related information and also the notes and books reference required. The portal also includes coding 
questions for interview purpose, and the  regular live coding competition where one person can analyse his\her
performance. In addition to this, the portal includes a speed typing test to help the students enhance their
typing speed and build up a code quickly and efficiently.
        
The portal has a greater importance and need as no one would now have to rush  to different 
WhatsApp groups and create nuisance at MS Teams anymore in  order to look for work but just
has to log in into the portal.
        
According to present conditions, when there is no certainty of life, it becomes a problem 
for every student to be  attentive in all lectures and work on his future skills; <ul><li>Our portal will be a helping hand to all of them suffering  in this hard time.</li><li>The portal would provide all the lecture notes and the PDF of all books suggested by the teachers to 
access  anytime, anywhere.</li><li>Moreover, the portal will also conduct regular coding contests for adding an edge to the preparation for 
interviews.</li><li>Other than that, our portal includes an Online Typing Test which would analyse the time one takes to 
write  certain code. The lesser time one takes, the greater it increases the chances of getting selected 
in any interview.  Afterall,<b> Time is money.</b></li></ul>
